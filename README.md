# graph-selector-syntax

> I'm experimenting with this language to determine if it should become the successor to the [flowchart-fun](https://flowchart.fun) language. I wrote a blog post about it [here](https://flowchart.fun/blog/2019/05/19/graph-selector-syntax).

- a parser written in typescript
- a website of example usages of the parser

### What does the syntax look like?

### What does the parser output look like?
